Using:: Walmart API / Kroger API 

Walmart API:
There is poor setup documentaion for Windows so I suggets using Linux/Unix for a much smoother process. 

Walamrt API TO DO:
1. [STILL Awaiting approval] for Walmart Online pickup and delivery services API subscription 

Kroger API TO DO:
1. user login and auth
2. use product api to get product data and check if product exists  
3. use cart api to populate cart 
4. launch Kroger webpage to allow user to select ways to proceed checkout
